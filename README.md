## Omar Quimbaya (@writingpanda) 🐼 ##

## Introduction. ##

I am a Principle Field Security Specialist at GitHub. Before that, I worked for Snyk, Cisco, Tenable, and other security companies as either a developer or a sales engineer.

I am based out of Texas. If you want to connect with me or learn more about me, please visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omarleonardoquimbaya/).

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to be a sumo wrestler, and I won second place in state-wide tournaments twice. 

## How can we work together? ##

I am a collaborative person at heart. I don't believe great things happen because one person does all of the work; it takes a group of people to make a difference. 

If you would like to work with me on a deal, speaking to internal GitHub employees, please answer these questions for me:

1. How can I help?
2. Where can I learn more?
3. How do we win?

This will help me understand my role and how I can best support you in your efforts. I appreciate the effort to work with me! 

Please let me know how best I can work with you, as well. Collaboration works both ways.
